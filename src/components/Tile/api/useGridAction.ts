 * @param Object.onLoadEnd - A callback function executed when a grid action or row action is completed or failed.
 * @param Object.throwError - A flag indicating whether to throw an error if a grid action or row action fails.

 * @param Object.fetchRow - A function that fetches a row.
 * @param Object.onAction - A callback function executed when a grid action is performed. This function receives the action name, the rows to perform the action on, and a

 *   - selectedRows - An array of selected rows in the grid.
 *   - gridProps - The grid properties.
 *   - commitAction - A function that commits a grid action. This function receives the action name and calls the onAction callback function with the selected rows.
 *   - commitRowAction - A function that commits a row action. This function receives the action name and the row and calls the onRowAction callback function.
